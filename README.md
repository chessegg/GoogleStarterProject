# GoogleStarterProject

Intern Starter Project for Google 2020 Summer Internship working with OpenTelemetry.

Visit: https://finder-dot-chessegg.wl.r.appspot.com to try out the services.

This project consists of three services: 
-The FoodFinder service allows a user to specify an ingredient they need, 
and consults with other services to try to find vendors with that for the user. 
-The FoodSupplier service acts as a database of FoodVendors, providing a candidate set of vendors who it believes may deal in the 
ingredient the user is looking for. 
-The FoodVendor service offers certain ingredients at certain prices, and maintains an inventory of each.

The application as a whole is meant to be run on Google App Engine (GAE)
